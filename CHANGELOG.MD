# Changelog

## v0.6.0

This release adds the ``debounceDelay`` parameter (default is 0). It allows to discard the spinner for fast and repeated http requests, which can be annoying under some conditions.

See [customization](https://github.com/mpalourdio/ng-http-loader#customizing-the-spinner)

The library footprint has been reduced by minifying templates and stylesheets before inlining them.

The library now takes advantage of [RxJS lettable operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/lettable-operators.md)

## v0.5.1

This release fixes a bug that could cause the spinner to not show if an http request were performed **before** the spinner component was initialized.  
The responsible ``Subject`` has been replaced by a ``ReplaySubject``.

## v0.5.0

The module is now splitted in sub-modules for more convenience. See [usage](https://github.com/mpalourdio/ng-http-loader#usage).  
It's an **opt-in** feature. The "old" module import method, by simply declaring ``NgHttpLoaderModule``, is still fully supported. 

**BC break** : paths of components and services have changed.
- Components are now located in the ``components`` folders.
- Services are now located in the ``services`` folders.

## v0.4.0

Added **angular 5** full support. The last version compatible with angular 4 is ``version 0.3.4``

## v0.3.4

Fixed default spinners background.

## v0.3.0

This release gives the possibility to filter http requests that should not be handled by the interceptor by providing an array of URL regex to the component's ``filteredUrlPatterns`` property.

## v0.2.0

Definitely switch to the new HttpClientModule api available from angular 4.3

## v0.1.0

Before completely removing HttpInterceptorService, provide a parallel implementation based on the new built-in angular 4.3 intercepto
