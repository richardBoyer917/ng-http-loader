# ng-http-interceptor

## Installation

To install this library, run:

```bash
$ npm install ng-http-interceptor --save
```

This package provides an HTTP Interceptor, and a spinner component. The HTTP interceptor listens to all HTTP requests
and shows a spinner during pending requests.

It's compatible with Angular 4+.

The spinner has been taken from [SpinKit](https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit).
